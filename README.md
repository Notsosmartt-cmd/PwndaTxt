# PwndaTxt
Encrypted text editor based on PwndaHash built on Python

Purpose:

Proof-of-Concept file encryption text editor used for viewing or modifying encrypted PwndaHash text files without saving plain text to hard drive. Decrypts files into ram, and re-encrypts before saving back to drive to prevent plain text from leaving traces on storage.


Intended to view or modify personal private keys or mnemonic phrases for crypto wallets on public facing computers or non-cold storage hard drives while keeping the file encrypted.
